### 6. System architecture

The ZapZapCards platform uses a modular architecture: a user-friendly frontend communicates with a Node.js backend, which handles AI flashcard generation and data storage. Authentication is managed separately using Clerk, while the backend integrates with Groqâ€™s AI models and Firebase as the database to deliver seamless, real-time flashcard creation.
